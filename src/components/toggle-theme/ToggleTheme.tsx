/**
 * A React component that provides a button to toggle between light and dark themes.
 *
 * This component uses the `useTheme` hook from the `next-themes` library to manage
 * the current theme state. It switches the theme between "light" and "dark" when clicked.
 *
 * The button includes two icons:
 * - A Sun icon, displayed when the theme is light.
 * - A Moon icon, displayed when the theme is dark.
 *
 * Both icons are styled with Tailwind CSS classes to handle transitions and animations
 * when toggling between themes.
 *
 * Accessibility:
 * - The button includes an `aria-label` for screen readers to describe its purpose.
 * - A visually hidden `<span>` element provides additional accessible text for screen readers.
 *
 * @component
 * @returns {JSX.Element} The rendered toggle theme button.
